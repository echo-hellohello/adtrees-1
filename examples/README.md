What the functions do (see comments in the code for more detailed explanation):

- ex_handmade
  - creation of an ADTree when not using ADTool
  - creation of an output .xml file accepted by ADTool
- ex_basic
  - initializing ADTree from an .xml file produced by ADTool
  - accessing the root node
  - checking whether a node is countered and accessing the countermeasure
  - displaying sets of basic actions of the actors
  - checking whether there are repeated basic actions in the tree
- ex_semantics
  - computing set semantics
  - computing defense semantics (in trees with no repeated basic actions, for now)
- ex_cost
  - different ways of defining basic assignments
  - outputting basic assignment to a file
  - defining attribute domains
  - using predefined attribute domains
  - computing the value of an attribute:
    - using the bottom-up evaluation
    - using the evaluation on set semantics
    - using the repeated bottom-up procedure
- ex_pareto
  - defining Pareto attribute domains
  - defining basic assignment for Pareto attribute domains
- ex_optimization
  - defining optimization problems for ADTrees
