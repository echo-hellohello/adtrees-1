version 0.0.5
new content:
	ADNode.copy - creates new ADNode with the same parameters as the original one
	ADTree.root_always_achievable - checks whether it is always (i.e., under any behaviour of the defender) possible for the attacker to achieve the root goal
	default_domains.maxProb - domain for computing maximal probability of success over minimal attacks
	default_domains.satisfiability - domain for verifying whether under given behaviour of the actors the root goal is achieved
	optimizers.py - adds two functions: optimal_attacks, and optimal_countermeasures
	ParetoDomain - extended to accommodate the maxProb attribute domain
	BasicAssignment - when creating from a .txt file, ignore lines starting with '#' (i.e., comments can be added to those files)
fixes:
	BasicAssignment - int -> float

version 0.0.4

	ADTree.defense_semantics can now be applied to ADTrees containing repeated basic actions
